  I'm a student at the University of Miami, expecting to graduate with a BSBA in May 2024 with a with a double major in Business Analytics and Business Technology and a minor in Spanish. I am passionate about people, learning, problem solving, and approaching my work with creativity and curiosity.
  <br><br>
  In summer 2023 I was the Executive Technology and Computing Intern for the Executive IT team at Mars Inc, where I completed projects involving internal digital adoption, automating workflows, and organizing data. I've also interned for a local business in Spain, and served as a tutor for Business Analytics, Statisticsc, and Calculus in college.
