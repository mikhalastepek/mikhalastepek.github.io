  I'm a student at the University of Miami, expecting to graduate with a BSBA in May 2024 with a with a double major in Business Analytics and Business Technology and a Spanish minor. I am passionate about people, learning, problem solving, and approaching my work with creativity and curiosity.
  <br><br>
  In summer 2023 I interned for the Executive IT team at Mars Inc, where I completed projects involving increasing digital adoption, automating workflows, and organizing data. I've also interned for a local business in Spain, and worked as a tutor for the business school.
