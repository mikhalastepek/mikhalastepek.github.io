  I expect to graduate in May 2024 from the University of Miami, pursuing a BSBA with a double major in Business Analytics and Business Technology and a minor in Spanish. I am passionate about learning, problem solving, and approaching my work with creativity and curiosity. I work efficiently alone, but I find inspiration in social environments and excel at bringing people together to produce solutions.
  <br><br>
  In summer 2023 I was the Executive Technology and Computing Intern for the Executive IT team at Mars Inc. I completed projects involving internal digital adoption, automating workflows, and organizing data. I gained experience as a business translator, working in internal communications, and integrating technology solutions.
