  I am expecting to graduate in May 2024 from the University of Miami, pursuing a BSBA with a double major in Business Analytics and Business Technology and a minor in Spanish. I am passionate about learning, problem solving, and approaching my work with creativity and curiosity. I work efficiently alone, but I find inspiration in social environments and excel at bringing people together to produce solutions.
  <br><br>
  In the summer of 2023 I interned for the Executive IT team at Mars Inc, where I was an Executive Technology and Computing Intern. I completed projects involving internal IT education, increasing digital adoption, automating workflows, and organizing data. I gained experience as a business translator, working in internal communications, and developing internal technology solutions.
  <br><br>
  During the spring semester of my junior year at UM, I studied abroad in Seville, Spain, where I studied culture, continued learning spanish, traveled to 7 countries, and served as a business development intern at a local business called La Terraza del Cristina. This internship challenged me to adapt to working in an international, multicultural environment. I worked on multiple online travel agency platforms, made updates to the company's websites, ran their social media, and helped host sangria tastings and food tours.
